# üî• Hotline News
Hotline News is a sample news application focused on **scalability**, **maintainability**, and **testability**.  
This project is built using **Clean Architecture** and follows a **modular** structure, making it a great foundation for large-scale applications.

Each module depends only on more stable modules, which reduces the ripple effect of changes across the codebase.  
Modules are **highly cohesive** and **loosely coupled**, resulting in better separation of concerns and easier testing.

The project also uses **Convention Plugins** to simplify Gradle configuration and keep the build logic clean and reusable across modules.

The project is still evolving and has a lot of room for improvement. Contributions are welcome!
